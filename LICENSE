This public open license is a license agreement granting anyone who receives a copy of the Work (or the Derivative Work), as defined below, the right to use the Work under the terms and conditions set forth below.
By using the Work in any way, you accept all of the terms and conditions of the License without exception.

1. Terms, definitions, general provisions.

1.1. "Adaptation" means making changes to the Work or the Derivative Work solely for the purpose of enabling the Work to function on your specific hardware or under the control of specific software installed on your equipment.

1.2. "You" (the licensee of this License) means any individual (or group of individuals - co-authors) or legal entity that has received a copy of the Work by any means not inconsistent with the Law, in any form and on any medium;
1.2.1. "recipient" means any person or entity that has received from You (or other licensee of this License) as part of the Distribution a copy of the Work and/or Derivative Work created by You (Your Derivative Work) and/or other licensee of this License. The recipient also automatically becomes a licensee of this License.

1.3. "Law" means the legislation of the Russian Federation applicable to legal relations arising between you and Sberbank under this License;

1.4. "License" means this license agreement granting the right to use the Work and any Derivative Works;

1.5. "Modification" means making any changes to a Work or Derivative Work other than an Adaptation;

1.5.1. "Your Modifications" means any Modifications you have made to a Work or Derivative Work

1.6. "Work" means software (computer program) and/or other work written in a programming language in the form of object code and/or source code, which right of use is granted under the terms of this License, as expressly stated in the accompanying documentation and/or in the program files of the corresponding Work, and/or on Sberbank's Website, and/or in any notice accompanying the Distribution of the Work. The exclusive right to the Work under the Law and by virtue of the fact of creation belongs in its entirety to Sberbank;



1.7. "Derivative Work" means any result of intellectual activity created in any way on the basis of and/or using the object code and/or source code of the Work (including the Derivative Work) as a whole or any part thereof, including, without limitation, through Modification. For the purposes of this License, the term "Your Derivative Work" is included into the term of "Derivative Work" except where the text of the License expressly states otherwise.

1.7.1.

For the avoidance of doubt, because the terms of this License do not allow sublicensing of the Work and any Derivative Work, nor do they allow you to transfer the exclusive right to any Derivative Work in its entirety (see Section 7 of this License) to another person, any Derivative Work created at your request by any third party will be a Derivative Work created by another licensee of this License, not your Derivative Work.

1.7.2. The inclusion of the Work in a collection of different works for the sole purpose of storing such a collection on a single tangible medium (or in the memory of an electronic device/computer), including on which the Work is distributed, together with other separate independent works that are not Derivative Works and do not form a Composite Work together with the Work, does not result in creation of a Derivative Work. Such inclusion of the Work in said selection does not apply the provisions of this License to the remaining independent works.

1.8. "Distribution" means any transmission (including for any purpose) of any copy of the Work (and/or the Derivative Work) by any means (including on any media) and in any form to any individual and/or legal entity, government agency, any public and/or international organization, any educational institution or agency, including publication, making available to the public or posting (including posting a hyperlink allowing you to download or create an electronic copy of the Work / Derivative Work) in the Internet;

1.9. "Composite Work" means a Derivative Work created by combining, incorporating, statically linking, integrating, compiling (or by other similar means) a Work and/or Derivative Work (and/or parts thereof) with another intellectual creation at the level of object code and/or source text. For the purposes of interpretation of the terms of this License, and for the avoidance of doubt, the term "Derivative Work" includes a Composite Work, unless otherwise specified in the License;

Otherwise, anyone acting in bad faith, but within the bounds of the Law (or other applicable law), may seize the exclusive right to the Derivative Work in its entirety, which in turn may result in both lawsuits against the recipients of your Derivative Work and/or your address, and the suspension (termination) of further development of the Work, your Derivative Works and/or any Derivative Works in general.

7.1.1. The exclusive right in any Derivative Work created by you (your Derivative Work) and/or any other licensee of this License to the original source code and/or object code of the Work used by you (and/or any other licensee of this License) in creating any Derivative Work and contained in such Derivative Work belongs in full and without any restrictions to Sberbank from the creation (date) (as expressed in objective form) of such Derivative Work. Sberbank retains sole and exclusive ownership of all of the original source code and object code for the Work used by You (and/or any other licensee of this License) in creating any Derivative Work (and all subsequent Derivative Works without exception) and contained in any such Derivative Work created by You (in Your Derivative Work) and/or any other licensee of this License. You may use and Distribute the Derivative Work created by you (your Derivative Work) and/or any other licensee of this License only under the terms and conditions of this License.

You hereby also hereby grant Sberbank personally the right to use any and all of your modifications you have made to the Work (or to any other Derivative Work created by another licensee of this License) to create your Derivative Work, but on the terms of a simple (non-exclusive) royalty-free (without payment of any fee to you for the right to use) license in effect throughout the term of Your copyright (exclusive) right to Your Modifications and within the countries of the entire World, for any purpose, by any means, including, but not limited to, the following, as specified in Article 1270 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, including but not limited to the following: making changes (Modification / other processing), including for the creation of Derivative works (including those that include your changes), Distribution, Adaptation, provision of services through and / or using your changes (and / or the functionality of your changes).

For the avoidance of any doubt, Derivative Works created by Sberbank (including those incorporating your modifications) are not subject to this License, but may be made available and/or distributed by Sberbank under the terms of both this License and other license agreements (at Sberbank's discretion), including those for compensation.

7.1.4. Sberbank always relies on your good faith in using the Works and Derivative Works, whether created by you or other licensees, and in complying with the terms of this License, but because this License is in fact an open license and allows unlimited creation of Derivative Works, Sberbank cannot be assured that you have retained all copyright notices of the creators of the Derivative Works. In connection with the above, and in order to avoid possible claims from the authors of the Derivative Works:

* You, as the author of the Derivative Work created by you, hereby consent and authorize Sberbank not to refer to you as the author of the Derivative Work created by you in any use by Sberbank of the Derivative Work created by you, and you also authorize Sberbank to use or not to use the name of the Derivative Work created by you at its discretion.

7.1.6. Each time you distribute the Work and/or Derivative Work under the terms of this License, the recipient automatically receives from Sberbank the right to use the corresponding Work (or any part thereof), including the Work you used to create the Derivative Work under the terms of this License, and becomes a licensee under the License. You are not responsible for compliance with the terms of this License by any third parties (including other licensees and transferees).
